    help: >-
      How many processor cores you need.  Unless you run something like
      "doMC" or "doParallel" in your code, R will only ever use 1
      processor core.  Leave this set to 1 if unsure.
  memory:

    help: >-
      How much memory you need.  If the amount of memory you request goes
      over certain thresholds, it will affect your wait time.  The points
      at which this happens are 124, 180, 248, 370, 750 and 1000 GB.
